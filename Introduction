__________________________________ INTRODUCTION _______________________________________________________________________

    Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) are fundamental concepts in computer science and programming. 
    They provide essential methods and techniques for solving complex problems in an efficient way, 
    helping to improve the performance of software. By understanding DSA,
    developers can write code that works correctly while also being fast, 
    scalable, and able to handle larger datasets effectively.


    A data structure is a method of organizing, managing, and storing data so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. 
    The choice of data structure greatly impacts the performance of an application, 
    as different structures are optimized for different tasks. 
    Using the right data structure can significantly improve both the speed of execution and memory usage.

    Here are some common data structures:

    Arrays: A collection of elements stored in contiguous memory locations.
                Arrays allow for fast access to elements using an index.


    Linked Lists: A sequence of elements where each element (node) points to the next. 
                    Itâ€™s useful for dynamic memory allocation, as elements can be added or removed easily.


    Stacks: A linear data structure that follows the Last In,
                First Out (LIFO) principle. The last element added is the first to be removed.


    Queues: A linear data structure that follows the First In, 
                First Out (FIFO) principle. The first element added is the first to be removed.


    Trees: Hierarchical structures used to model relationships, 
                with a root element and child elements. Binary search trees (BSTs) are a popular type of tree.


    Graphs: A collection of nodes (vertices) and edges that represent relationships and networks, 
                such as in social networks or transportation systems.


    Hash Tables: A data structure that stores data in key-value pairs,
                    allowing for fast access to elements through a hash function. This is highly efficient for lookups.
